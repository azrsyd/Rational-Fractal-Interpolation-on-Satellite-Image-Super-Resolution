# Rational-Fractal-Interpolation-on-Satellite-Image-Super-Resolution
SATELLITE IMAGE SUPER RESOLUTION USING RATIONAL FRACTAL INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR EXTENSIVE MONITORING OF MANGROVE FOREST DESTRUCTION 

Protecting mangrove forests is very important because these forests provide extensive benefits in various aspects, such as physical, chemical, biological, and socio-economic. Mangrove forests are ecologically vulnerable to ecosystem damage, so monitoring mangrove forest damage is important for preparation, management, and rehabilitation. One effective monitoring method is to use remote sensing technology, especially satellite imagery. To improve the quality of Landsat images, the Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) technique was used with the Rational Fractal Interpolation method. This method was chosen because it does not require a large dataset, given the limited availability of Landsat images. The Rational Fractal Interpolation method has the advantage of maintaining the edge structure of the image during the image reconstruction process. The application of this method involves several steps, such as regional division, calculation of fractal dimensions, calculation of scaling factors, image pixel interpolation, and pixel mapping. The highest average performance results measured using PSNR were obtained when applying super resolution with the rational fractal interpolation method to 2x magnification RGB satellite images with a value of 38.3762, 3x magnification with a value of 35.8071, and 4x magnification with a value of 33.6957. The accuracy level produced by super resolution using the rational fractal interpolation method in measuring the area of mangrove forest damage was 98.7752%.
